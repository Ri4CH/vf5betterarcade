Randomizes the stages NOT for Dural, makes the arcade more difficult and set this difficulty for all stages.
Just put everything to your VF5 folder and enable the mod with ShinRyuModManager.

vf5betterarcade.exe - uses for randomizing the stages in "mods\Better Arcade Mode\rom\game_score.txt" (modding this file will allow you to change the difficulty if it's too hard for you, do not change formatting this file)
